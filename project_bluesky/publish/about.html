      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>This is the about page. On it we explain all of the different functions and tools that you have at your disposal as an author. If we decide to keep this I will actually figure out how to implement that and go to the effort of putting it together.</p>

      <h3>Sidebar</h3>
      <p>I don't even know if we need an about page for this side of the site. I put one in cause I thought it might be a good idea to explain how things were supposed to work over on this side of the site, and what to expect from all the dashboard, tools, contact, and writing pages. It might be overkill and super annoying though. Let me know if you think it should be done differently, like maybe in a help page or something, that would have both the contact and about pages merged in to one?</p>
